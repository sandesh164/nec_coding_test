Implemented user login and registration system with file uploading functionality

-added code to master branch.

-added query.sql in main repository for importing mysql tables.

-used jQuery / ajax, HTML and bootstrap for frontend. 

Instructions:
-Setup the project and import sql file.

-Index.php is the main file in the repository which redirects to sign up page.

-.php extenison has been removed using .htaccess file. So we can use urls without .php at the end.

-Once the setup is done, enter the url ex: [http://localhost/nec_coding_test/index] OR [http://localhost/nec_coding_test/views/user_registration] 

-Sign up page will be displayed where user can register using email, password and image.

-Once signed up, it will redirect to login page.

-When logged in, home page will be displayed with welcome message, user profile photo and logout link.
